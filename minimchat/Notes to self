    - Learned that a form can't have a form inside of it, otherwise will cause an error
        - handleSend in InputBox wasn't getting called because of this error. The preventDefault() was never called.
    - Learning what useState is... Still to implement actually sending messages.
    - Looking into what server to use/host this with. Maybe amazon's lightsail?
